# API Playgroud
This repository is a place to experiment with Go, the Chi router and its associated middlewares, and MongoDB.

## Chi
Chi is a popular router within the Go community which offers a clean way to organize routes and add middleware. Additionally, Chi
has the `jwtauth` repo, which offers a way to use Json Web Tokens to authenticate users.

## MongoDB 
Mongo is a popular document store which also offers full text search and aggregations, among other features. My interest in using Mongo
was to create a fast CRUD application with a powerful search function.
